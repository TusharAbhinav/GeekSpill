# GeekSpill Release Notes (v1.0.0-beta)

Hey there, Tech Enthusiast! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to GeekSpill â€“ born from a simple, relatable problem: who has the time to hop between a dozen company websites just to stay updated? 

As a solo developer, I've been there â€“ drowning in browser tabs, trying to keep up with tech blogs from Google, Apple, Meta, and beyond. GeekSpill is my solution to that endless scrolling and tab-switching madness.

This isn't some massive corporate project. This is a personal mission to solve a problem I've struggled with for years. No team meetings, no complex roadmaps â€“ just a straightforward solution for tech enthusiasts who want their information served fast and fresh.

Right now, our feature list might look small, but it's packed with potential. We'll document every update, improvement, and quirky bug fix in future releases. Think of this as version 1.0 â€“ the beginning of something that could make your tech reading life a whole lot easier.
